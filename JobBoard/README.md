Create a section of a job posting board where a user can create one instance of a JobOpening class by submitting a form. It should include properties for a title, description, and contact info for the person posting the job.

If you're feeling fancy, make the contact info into an object with its own class declaration. Hint: A Contact object would include properties like a name, email and phoneNumber, and you would want to store it inside the JobOpening object.
